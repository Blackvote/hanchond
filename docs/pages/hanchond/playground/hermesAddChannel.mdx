# Add a New Channel

To connect two Cosmos networks, you need to create an IBC channel between them.

:::warning
This command assumes that you have already built a [Hermes binary](/hanchond/playground/buildHermes)
:::

## Command

The `hermes-add-channel` command takes two arguments, which are the chain IDs for both networks that you want to connect.

```sh
hanchond playground hermes-add-channel 1 2
Getting first node data...
Getting second node data...
Both chains are running
Relayer initialized
First chain added
Second chain added
Calling create channel
Channel created
```

:::info
Creating a channel will take around one minute because the relayer needs to send some transactions between the two chains.
