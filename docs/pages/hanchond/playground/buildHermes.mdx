# Build Hermes

To run two networks via IBC, you first need to set up a relater. The `build-hermes` command allows you to build the relayer from the source code.

:::warning
This process assumes that you have all the Hermes dependencies already installed in your system.
:::

## Build the Relayer

The `build-hermes` command supports the flag `--version` to build an specific tag. It defaults to version `v1.9.0`.

```sh
hanchond playground build-hermes
Cloning hermes version: v1.9.0
Building hermes...
Moving built binary...
Cleaning up...
```

:::info
The playground only supports one version of Hermes at the time, so if you build more than one relayer, the binaries will be overwritten.
