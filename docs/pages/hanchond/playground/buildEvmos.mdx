# Build Evmos

To run a network, you first need to chain binary. The command `build-evmos` allows you to build from tags

## Build from Github tags

Passing the version tag will automatically download the Github repo, build the binary and move the built binary to the playground data folder.

```sh
hanchond playground build-evmos v18.1.0
Cloning evmos version: v18.1.0
Building evmos...
Moving built binary...
```

## Build from a local repository

If you pass the `--path` flag, it will build your local Evmos and tag it for internal usage as `local`

```sh
hanchond playground build-evmos --path /Users/hanchon/devel/evmos/evmos
Building evmos...
Moving built binary..
```

:::info
Make sure that you are using the `local` version while interacting with the playground to use the Evmos built with the `--path` flag
