# Stop node

To stop a running node, the command `stop-node` can be used

```sh
hanchond playground stop-node 1
Node is no longer running
```

:::info
If the node is not running but still in the database, the command will remove the entry from the database and exit correctly.

If the node is set as not active in the database and the `stop-node` command is called, the process will exit with exit-code 1.
