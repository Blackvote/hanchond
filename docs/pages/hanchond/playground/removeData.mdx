# Remove Data

To start a new playground, you first need to remove old data.

```sh
hanchond playground remove-data
```

The `remove-data` command will remove the data folder for your playground, the only files that are kept are the built binaries.

:::danger
Removing the data will not stop the currently running processes. Make sure that you stop your processes before running the `remove-data` command.
