# IBC Transfer

The command `ibc-transfer` can be used to send IBC coins between two chains.

```sh
hanchond playground tx ibc-transfer evmos1dh0j0cppe0uktzl8reukddztkcygzrh7t5fx0n 1
37A2F48060D264039A98FC89083B98AA1DFF65D64A15C936147C17AB4B61098B
```

The command has 2 flags that can be set:

- Channel: it's the channel that will be used to send the transaction. It defaults to `channel-0`.
- Denom: it's the denomination of the token that you want to send. It defaults to the `base denom` of the chain.

:::info
The sender of the IBC transaction is the validator key of the node.
