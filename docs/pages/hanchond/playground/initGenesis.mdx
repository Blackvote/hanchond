# Init Genesis

Before starting the chain, a genesis file needs to be set up.

## Set up the genesis and config files

Running the `init-genesis` command will set up the genesis file and update the configuration files so the ports do not conflict with the rest of your network.

The ID argument is required, it must be an integer and will represent your chain.

```sh
hanchond playground init-genesis 1 --version local
Node added with id: 1
```

:::info
By default the `--version` flag will be `local`, it can be overwritten with any of the versions that were previously built
