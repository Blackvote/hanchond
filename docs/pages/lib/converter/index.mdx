# Converter

List of commonly used convert functions

## Base64 to Hex

After getting the Cosmos Block information from the Rest API, the information is encoded using `base64`, but normally the explorers display the information in hex format.

To convert from the API response to the encoding that is usually seen in explorers and wallets, the `Base64ToHexString` function can be used.

```go
proposer, _ := converter.Base64ToHexString(val.Block.Header.ProposerAddress)
hash, _ := converter.Base64ToHexString(val.BlockID.Hash)
```

## Generate Transaction Hash

When reading the API response for a Cosmos Block, you will get every tranasction included the block.

The transaction list is just the content of the transaction encoded using `base64`.

If you want to use the API endpoint to get the transaction logs, you will need the transaction hash.

If you already have the transactions bytes, the `GenerateCosmosTxHash` function can be used.

```go
hash := converter.GenerateCosmosTxHash(txBytes)
```

If the transaction is in `base64`, you can use the function `GenerateCosmosTxHashWithBase64`

```go
hash, err := converter.GenerateCosmosTxHashWithBase64(txBytes)
```

:::info
Note that if you send the transaction in `base64`, the function can error while changing the encoding, so that is why it also returns a possible error
