# Contract

The contract struct is used internally to associate an address and an ABI, so we can easily interact with the deployed contract.

## New Contract

This function is used mostly to instantiate the TxBuilder with the list of contracts that can be interacted with.

```go
contract := NewContract(address, abi)
```
